    Blue Lock is a 2022 sports anime about Japan's quest for World Cup glory, which leads the Japanese Football Association to create the titular program. The program gathers 300 high school forwards and puts them through a rigorous, competitive training regimen designed by Ego Jinpachi to foster the world's greatest "egoist" striker. The main character, Yoichi Isagi, is one of these players, and the series follows his journey to find his ultimate potential and become the leading striker.  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

• Focus on the Individual: The series emphasizes individual prowess and "ego," with players becoming stronger as they embrace their selfish desires for victory. [6]
