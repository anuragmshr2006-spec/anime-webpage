    Cyberpunk anime are stories set in high-tech, low-life dystopian futures, featuring a blend of advanced technology and societal collapse. The most well-known example is Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, a 2022 Netflix series by Studio Trigger set in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe. It follows a street kid named David who becomes a mercenary outlaw, known as an "edgerunner" or "cyberpunk", navigating a corrupt, violent city obsessed with cybernetic body modification. The anime is known for its hyperviolence, distinctive visual style, fast-paced narrative, and exploration of themes like the dangers of technological obsession, cyber-psychosis, and the struggle for survival.
