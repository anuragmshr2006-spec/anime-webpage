    One Piece is a long-running Japanese anime series produced by Toei Animation based on the best-selling manga by Eiichiro Oda. Following the adventures of Monkey D.

        Synopsis and plot
The story is set during the "Golden Age of Pirates," a time when pirates roam the seas in search of fame and riches following the death of the legendary Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. 
The journey to become Pirate King
Before his execution, Roger announced that his mythical treasure, the One Piece, was hidden somewhere along the perilous Grand Line.
Inspired by the Pirate King and his childhood hero Shanks, Monkey D. Luffy sets sail to assemble a crew, find the treasure, and become the new King of the Pirates.
Along the way, he recruits his "Straw Hat Pirates" and battles powerful enemies, uncovering dark secrets about the world and the corrupt World Government.
