    Jujutsu Kaisen is a popular dark fantasy anime series produced by the studio MAPPA, based on the manga of the same name by Gege Akutami. The story follows a high school student named Yuji Itadori, who is drawn into the secret world of Jujutsu Sorcerers. 
    Plot summary
The story begins with the following key events: 
Yuji Itadori, a kind-hearted and physically powerful high school student, joins his school's Occult Club for fun.
He finds a cursed talisman—one of the fingers of the powerful demon Ryomen Sukuna—that is being hunted by other Cursed Spirits.
To protect his friends from the Cursed Spirits, Yuji eats the finger and becomes the vessel for Sukuna.
Yuji manages to retain control of his body, and he is soon taken in by the Jujutsu Sorcerer Satoru Gojo.
He is enrolled at the Tokyo Jujutsu High School of Sorcery and joins a team with fellow first-year students Megumi Fushiguro and Nobara Kugisaki.
Yuji's mission is to hunt down and consume all of Sukuna's remaining fingers so that the demon can be exorcised once and for all.
