    The Apothecary Diaries is a historical mystery anime set in a fictional East Asian-inspired empire, focusing on the brilliant herbalist Mao Mao, who is sold into servitude in the imperial palace. Using her vast knowledge of medicine and poisons, Mao Mao solves complex medical and political mysteries for the emperor's officials, particularly the influential Jinshi. The series, known for its unique blend of detective work and court intrigue, was produced by Toho Animation Studio and OLM, with Norihiro Naganuma as director for the first season, and has been confirmed for a new sequel after the second season. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
