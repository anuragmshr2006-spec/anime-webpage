    Attack on Titan is a dark fantasy anime based on the manga by Hajime Isayama. It follows the story of protagonist Eren Yeager in a post-apocalyptic world where the last remnants of humanity reside within a walled city to protect themselves from gigantic, man-eating humanoids called Titans. 
    Plot summary
A century of peace shattered: For 100 years, humanity enjoyed peace behind three concentric walls. This ended when a "Colossal Titan" suddenly appeared, breached the outermost wall, and allowed other Titans to swarm the city.

The origin of the Titans: As the Scouts venture outside the walls, they discover shocking revelations about the true nature of the Titans and their world. They learn that they are not the last of humanity and that the true enemy lies both outside and inside the walls.
A wider conflict: The narrative expands to include political conspiracies, a history of oppression, and a global war. The story evolves from a simple man-versus-monster tale to a complex conflict where humanity is pitted against itself.<br>
